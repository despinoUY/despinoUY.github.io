I'm a Uruguayan developer and a tech enthusiast. I've been dictating some courses and doing academic research at [Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de la República](https://www.fing.edu.uy). I'm a member of [DATA Uruguay](https://www.data.org.uy), a civil society organization that works on open government, open data, transparency, freedom of information and participation through the use of civic technology.

Currently I'm mainly working with Drupal and Jekyll, but learning languages and new technologies is something I enjoy and find as a nice challenge everyday.

I'm also a voiceover talent and a motorsport journalist.
