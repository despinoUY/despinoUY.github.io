As you can see (and it's also stated at the footer), this site's theme is based on Minima. You may think that using this theme and following its documentation to customize it to your taste might be easy. Awfully, it's not. So, in order to help whoever it needs it, I'm writing this post. Let's start!

## SASS root file in Minima

At the [official documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) of this theme, you'll find that you must import Minima SCSS at `<your-site>/assets/css/style.scss`. Well, that's not particularly correct...

In fact, the CSS generated by this theme finally locates at `<your-site>/_site/assets` and it's called `main.css`. So, the SASS file should be located at `<your-site>/assets` and should be called `main.scss` in order to work.
